Cloud-Supported Drone-Based AI Vision for Crop Disease Classification

This project implements a deep learning-based vision system for crop health monitoring and disease classification. The system is designed to simulate how autonomous drones equipped with cameras can capture aerial imagery of crop fields and detect plant diseases in real time.

By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and cloud-supported workflows (Google Colab), the project demonstrates how lightweight AI models can aid precision agriculture, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Zero Hunger, Responsible Consumption, Climate Action).
